# Implementation Plan: Validate Schema Checkout Before Generating

**Branch**: `001-validate-schema-checkout` | **Date**: 2026-08-26 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-validate-schema-checkout/spec.md`

## Summary

Add a structural pre-flight check that runs immediately after the generator
selects the latest swagger file per service family (in
`parity.select_latest_swagger_files_by_service()`), and before any code
generation begins. It confirms every selected swagger file parses as JSON
and has the required top-level OpenAPI keys (`paths`, `info`,
`swagger`/`openapi`). If any file fails, `generate_modular_sdk()` raises
immediately, printing every offending file and reason together, before
`SDK_OUTPUT_DIR` is touched. This directly closes the gap found on
2026-08-26, where a locally truncated `device.swagger.json` (1625 lines cut
to 1) was silently accepted and caused the `kagent`/`monitoring` services to
disappear from the generated SDK undetected.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.14 (matches the rest of `scripts/generation/`)

**Primary Dependencies**: Standard library only (`json`) — no new dependency;
consistent with how `generate_sdk.py` already parses swagger files (see
`patched_swagger()`)

**Storage**: N/A (reads local files only, writes nothing on the validation
path itself)

**Testing**: pytest, following the existing `tests/generator/test_parity.py`
pattern (`tmp_path` fixtures, no real schema checkout needed)

**Target Platform**: Same as the rest of the generator — developer machines
and CI running `make generate` / `make generate local`

**Project Type**: Single project — internal build tooling
(`scripts/generation/`), not a user-facing library surface

**Performance Goals**: Negligible overhead versus the rest of a generation
run (which already runs `protoc` and `uvx openapi-python-generator` per
service); a JSON parse of ~40 small-to-medium swagger files adds a
sub-second cost

**Constraints**: MUST NOT change generated output for a valid schema
checkout (spec SC-002); MUST run unconditionally (no new CLI flag) so it
can't be silently skipped; MUST reuse the already-selected file list rather
than re-scanning the filesystem

**Scale/Scope**: ~40 swagger files across ~38-40 services today; a small,
single-purpose addition, not a validation framework

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Checked against `.specify/memory/constitution.md` v1.1.0:

| Principle / Section | Assessment |
| --- | --- |
| I. Generated Code Is Never Hand-Edited | PASS — only hand-written files change (`scripts/generation/parity.py`, `scripts/generate_sdk.py`); nothing under `gen/` is touched. |
| II. One Shared Runtime for Every Endpoint | N/A — this feature is generator tooling, not request/runtime code. |
| III. Generator Phase Modules Stay Independently Testable | PASS — validation logic is added to `parity.py` (an existing phase module) as plain functions, unit-tested in `tests/generator/test_parity.py` with no real schema checkout required. |
| IV. Test Coverage Must Be Exhaustive, Not Representative | N/A to this feature directly (that principle governs SDK endpoint coverage), but the same exhaustive spirit is applied to this feature's own tests (see Phase 1 quickstart / tasks). |
| V. End-to-End Tests Are Opt-In and Safe-by-Default | N/A — no e2e surface added. |
| VI. Credentials Never Enter Code, Logs, or Prompts | PASS — no credentials involved; error output is limited to file paths and structural reasons. |
| VII. Compatibility and Scope Discipline | PASS — additive only, no breaking change; change stays scoped to the one new gate (no unrelated refactors bundled in). |
| Dev Workflow guardrail (v1.1.0, schema-checkout integrity) | This feature is the code-level enforcement of that guardrail — it turns a documented manual check into an automatic one. |

No violations. Complexity Tracking table is not needed.

## Project Structure

### Documentation (this feature)

├── plan.md              # This file (/speckit-plan command output)
├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/speckit-plan command)

└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/speckit-tasks command - NOT created by /speckit-plan)
```

No `contracts/` directory: this feature has no external interface (API,
CLI flag, or public library surface) — it's an internal safety gate inside
the existing generation pipeline, matching the plan template's own
guidance to skip contracts for purely internal build tooling.

                                   # shaped like the 2026-08-26 incident
```

**Structure Decision**: Single project (this repo has no
frontend/backend/mobile split). The new logic lives in the existing
`parity.py` phase module rather than a new module, because it operates on
the exact same "which swagger files will we trust for this run" concern
`parity.py` already owns (`select_latest_swagger_files_by_service`) — no new
abstraction or module is introduced for what is fundamentally one small,
related check.
