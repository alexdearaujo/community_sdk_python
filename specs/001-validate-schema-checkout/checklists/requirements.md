# Specification Quality Checklist: Validate Schema Checkout Before Generating

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- This is an internal tooling feature (the "user" is the SDK maintainer
  running the generator), so success criteria reference project-specific
  commands (`make generate local`) and paths (`src/kentik_api/gen/`) rather
  than a generic UI — that's the appropriate level of concreteness here, not
  a leaked implementation detail (no specific validation library, JSON
  schema, or code structure is prescribed).
- All items pass on first draft; no `/speckit-clarify` round needed before
  `/speckit-plan`.
