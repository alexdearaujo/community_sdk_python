# HAND-WRITTEN: not modified by `make generate`. Edit directly.
"""Which operations a future retry policy may replay (FR-032a, FR-033).

No post-response retry exists yet. This records the rule a later feature must
implement against, derived from each operation's HTTP verb rather than a
hand-kept list, so it stays correct as the schema grows. RFC 9110 section
9.2.2 defines GET, PUT, and DELETE as idempotent; POST and PATCH are not, so
replaying one can create or change something twice.
