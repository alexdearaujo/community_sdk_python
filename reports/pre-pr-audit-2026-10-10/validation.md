# Validation matrix for pre-PR audit report

Date: 2026-10-10
Target report: [reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/report.md](reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/report.md)

## Validation method

> Only the written record is tracked in git. The `evidence/` scripts and the spot-check output and artifacts stay local, because they hold machine-specific paths and about 6 MB of scratch copies. Links to them work in the author's working tree only.

- Executed all evidence Python scripts under [reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/evidence](reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/evidence) with a 25s timeout per script.
- Corpus size: 168 scripts.
- Execution result: 136 exit 0, 32 non-zero, 0 timeout.
- Non-zero scripts were mostly expected crash repros (exit -11) or scripts that require scratch args/fixtures.
- Added static source checks for claims that are design-time or config-time, not runtime repros.
- Replayed C1-C5 manual spot checks via
  [reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/run_manual_spot_check.py](reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/run_manual_spot_check.py).
- Operator-visible replay output is archived in
  [reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/manual-spot-check-output.md](reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/manual-spot-check-output.md).
- Structured replay records are in
  [reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/manual-spot-check-artifacts](reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/manual-spot-check-artifacts).

Status legend:

- Confirmed (run): reproduced by direct script execution in this session.
- Confirmed (static): verified from source/config in this session.
- Partial: some sub-claims verified, at least one part needs extra fixture or a dedicated external environment.

## Remediation execution header

## US1 blocker state update (2026-10-11)

| Finding ID | Remediation state | Evidence links | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | fixed | [src/kentik_api/core/rest_runtime.py](src/kentik_api/core/rest_runtime.py), [tests/generated/test_endpoint_schema_coverage.py](tests/generated/test_endpoint_schema_coverage.py) | Unknown enum parsing now raises a KentikError-path exception instead of raw ValidationError. |
| B2 | fixed (live) | [scripts/generate_sdk.py](scripts/generate_sdk.py), [tests/generator/test_generate_sdk.py](tests/generator/test_generate_sdk.py), [tests/generated/test_alert_acknowledgement.py](tests/generated/test_alert_acknowledgement.py) | A versioned name that would overwrite an existing schema keeps its prefix. Live proof on 2026-10-13: `alert_list` with a `startedAt` filter returned 122 real alerts. All 122 parsed, and each `acknowledgement` is an `AlertAcknowledgement` object. The earlier 400 came from the call, not the SDK: the backend rejects an alert list with no `startedAt` range (other filters, pagination and sorting alone also fail). |
| B3 | deferred | [reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/evidence/gencode/repro_extctx.py](reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/evidence/gencode/repro_extctx.py), [reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/deferred-risks.md](reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/deferred-risks.md) | Needs schema-aware oneof required-field handling in generator pipeline. |
| B4 | deferred | [reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/evidence/generator/mitigation_lost.py](reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/evidence/generator/mitigation_lost.py), [reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/deferred-risks.md](reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/deferred-risks.md) | Needs pb tree layout redesign and wrapper generation updates. |
| B5 | fixed | [src/kentik_api/core/rest_runtime.py](src/kentik_api/core/rest_runtime.py), [tests/runtime/test_rest_runtime.py](tests/runtime/test_rest_runtime.py) | Credential normalization and transport failure hardening prevent token leakage in error text. |
| B6 | fixed | [src/kentik_api/transports/grpc_client.py](src/kentik_api/transports/grpc_client.py), [tests/runtime/test_rest_runtime.py](tests/runtime/test_rest_runtime.py) | Post-close gRPC calls are now rejected with ConfigurationError before channel use. |
| B7 | fixed | [src/kentik_api/core/grpc_runtime.py](src/kentik_api/core/grpc_runtime.py), [tests/runtime/test_grpc_runtime.py](tests/runtime/test_grpc_runtime.py) | gRPC per-call overrides now allow timeout-only changes from with_timeout and fail fast otherwise. |
| B8 | fixed | [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml), [src/kentik_api/core/api_config.py](src/kentik_api/core/api_config.py), [tests/runtime/test_api_config.py](tests/runtime/test_api_config.py) | `httpx<1` cap. Proxy routing uses `urllib.request.getproxies()`, not `httpx._utils`. Live check 2026-10-12: real REST call passed, a dead proxy broke the call, `NO_PROXY` bypassed it, and the SDK imported on httpx 1.0.dev6. |
| B9 | fixed | [src/kentik_api/transports/grpc_client.py](src/kentik_api/transports/grpc_client.py), [src/kentik_api/core/grpc_runtime.py](src/kentik_api/core/grpc_runtime.py), [tests/runtime/test_grpc_transport.py](tests/runtime/test_grpc_transport.py) | The channel allows 40 MiB and takes `grpc_options`. An oversize response raises `TransportError`, not a 429. Live check 2026-10-13: a real `list_devices` call with a 1 KiB limit raised the new error for a 153566-byte response. |
| B10 | fixed | [src/kentik_api/core/rest_runtime.py](src/kentik_api/core/rest_runtime.py), [tests/generated/test_endpoint_schema_coverage.py](tests/generated/test_endpoint_schema_coverage.py) | Enum values now use wire representation for path and query encoding. |
| B11 | deferred | [reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/evidence/gencode/wrapper_names.py](reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/evidence/gencode/wrapper_names.py), [reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/deferred-risks.md](reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/deferred-risks.md) | Public naming stability needs generator naming-strategy redesign. |
| B12 | fixed | [scripts/generation/error_package.py](scripts/generation/error_package.py), [src/kentik_api/core/grpc_runtime.py](src/kentik_api/core/grpc_runtime.py), [tests/generator/test_error_package.py](tests/generator/test_error_package.py), [tests/runtime/test_grpc_runtime.py](tests/runtime/test_grpc_runtime.py) | Response error classes extend their operation class. gRPC raises the same class as REST. Live check 2026-10-13: a real 404 was caught by `GetDeviceError` on REST (`GetDeviceUnexpectedError 404`) and on gRPC (`GetDeviceUnexpectedError 404 NOT_FOUND`). |
| B13 | fixed | [tests/e2e/conftest.py](tests/e2e/conftest.py), [tests/e2e/test_endpoints_e2e.py](tests/e2e/test_endpoints_e2e.py) | Live e2e now requires explicit flag, no forced api.example.com override, and stricter pass criteria. |

## US2 generator and release state update (2026-10-12)

| Finding ID | Remediation state | Evidence links | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | fixed | [scripts/generation/parity.py](scripts/generation/parity.py), [tests/generator/test_parity.py](tests/generator/test_parity.py) | An empty swagger selection now raises before generation. |
| P4 | partial | [scripts/generate_sdk.py](scripts/generate_sdk.py), [tests/generator/test_parity.py](tests/generator/test_parity.py) | A protoc failure now re-raises and fails the run. Staging-directory atomic swap is deferred. |
| P5 | fixed | [scripts/generation/parity.py](scripts/generation/parity.py), [tests/generator/test_wrapper_generation.py](tests/generator/test_wrapper_generation.py) | Versions compare by year-month, then alpha < beta < final, then number. Unparsed names such as `v1` sort lowest. |
| P6 | partial | [scripts/generation/api_surface.py](scripts/generation/api_surface.py), [scripts/release_notes.py](scripts/release_notes.py), [tests/generator/test_release_notes.py](tests/generator/test_release_notes.py) | The surface record (schema 3) keeps parameters and return types. Removed or retyped parameters and changed returns are breaking. The changelog gate needs a whole token in a code span. Unresolvable `--since`, ancestor-tag baselines, and `packaging`-based requirement parsing are deferred. |
| P7 | fixed | [scripts/generate_sdk.py](scripts/generate_sdk.py) | Patched swagger temp files go to the system temp directory, not the schema checkout. A regeneration gave a byte-identical tree. |

### L1-L13 triage

None of L1-L13 is triggered by the current schema. A regeneration at the local schema checkout is byte-identical to the committed tree. Each fix needs a generator design choice (naming policy, proto relinking, template escaping), so all 13 are deferred to the next schema-sync work and recorded in the deferred-risk ledger. No `fixup.py` change was made (T033).

Verification (2026-10-12): `make generate local` leaves the tree unchanged, and the mocked layers pass (2966 passed, 145 skipped).

## US3 runtime state update (2026-10-12)

| Finding ID | Remediation state | Evidence links | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | fixed | [src/kentik_api/core/rest_runtime.py](src/kentik_api/core/rest_runtime.py), [tests/runtime/test_rest_runtime.py](tests/runtime/test_rest_runtime.py) | A non-UTF-8 body now raises an `HTTPException`, on both the error and the success path. |
| R2 | partial | [tests/runtime/test_rest_runtime.py](tests/runtime/test_rest_runtime.py) | The non-UTF-8 and non-JSON 200 paths raise `HTTPException`. The JSON `null` and list shapes need generated-code changes and are deferred. |
| R3 | fixed | [src/kentik_api/errors/__init__.py](src/kentik_api/errors/__init__.py), [tests/runtime/test_rest_runtime.py](tests/runtime/test_rest_runtime.py) | `HTTPException` and its subclasses now survive a pickle round trip. |
| R8 | fixed | [src/kentik_api/core/api_config.py](src/kentik_api/core/api_config.py), [src/kentik_api/client.py](src/kentik_api/client.py), [tests/runtime/test_rest_runtime.py](tests/runtime/test_rest_runtime.py) | `inf` and `nan` timeouts raise `ConfigurationError`. A non-string `region` raises `ConfigurationError`. |
| R12 | partial | [src/kentik_api/core/grpc_runtime.py](src/kentik_api/core/grpc_runtime.py), [tests/runtime/test_grpc_runtime.py](tests/runtime/test_grpc_runtime.py) | A bad gRPC argument now raises `ConfigurationError`, not `ParseError`. The missing `update_mask` argument is deferred. |
| R4, R5, R6, R7, R9, R11, R14, R16 | deferred | [reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/deferred-risks.md](reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/deferred-risks.md) | Each needs a design change in the config, transport or generator. |
| R10 | partial | [src/kentik_api/core/rest_runtime.py](src/kentik_api/core/rest_runtime.py) | Traced: httpx encodes a space in a query value as `+`. Only one live call can show whether Envoy decodes it. e2e runs are opt-in, so this stays open. |
| R13 | partial | [src/kentik_api/core/grpc_runtime.py](src/kentik_api/core/grpc_runtime.py) | Confirmed: `map_grpc_error` ignores `google.rpc` error details. Quota comes from the initial metadata only. Deferred: no consumer needs the details today. |
| R15 | partial | Generated models | Traced to the model output step, not the runtime. Deferred to generator work. |

Verification (2026-10-12): runtime and generated suites pass (2708 passed, 145 skipped).

## US4 test-gap state update (2026-10-12)

| Finding ID | Remediation state | Evidence links | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T2 | partial | [tests/runtime/test_credentials.py](tests/runtime/test_credentials.py) | A test now proves the transport attaches the credentials plugin with exact metadata. The in-process `grpc.server` test is deferred. |
| T5 | fixed | [tests/runtime/test_grpc_runtime.py](tests/runtime/test_grpc_runtime.py) | Existing tests already assert the per-call `timeout` reaches the stub. |
| T6 | fixed | [tests/smoke/test_client_mounts_and_calls.py](tests/smoke/test_client_mounts_and_calls.py) | Credential precedence was already tested. A new test checks the REST and gRPC hosts for `us` and `eu`. |
| T8 | fixed | [tests/generated/test_retry_eligibility.py](tests/generated/test_retry_eligibility.py) | Counts now derive from `api_surface.json`. |
| T10 | fixed | [tests/generated/test_grpc_stub_wiring.py](tests/generated/test_grpc_stub_wiring.py) | The mixin is parsed with `ast`. A new test checks every service with a wrapper is covered. |
| T1, T3, T4, T7, T9 | deferred | [reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/deferred-risks.md](reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/deferred-risks.md) | Each needs swagger-derived fixtures or a gRPC routing record. |

Verification (2026-10-12): full mocked suite passes (2992 passed, 145 skipped).

## US5 packaging and docs state update (2026-10-12)

| Finding ID | Remediation state | Evidence links | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| K1 | deferred | [reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/deferred-risks.md](reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/deferred-risks.md) | `dist/` is git-ignored build output. The owner deletes it by hand before any upload. |
| K2 | partial | [.github/workflows/release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml), [tests/smoke/test_packaging_contract.py](tests/smoke/test_packaging_contract.py) | The notes job now needs `publish`. The build job checks the version against the tag and the pre-release flag. Trusted publishing needs PyPI-side setup and is deferred. |
| K4, K5, K6 | fixed | [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml), [uv.lock](uv.lock), [tests/smoke/test_packaging_contract.py](tests/smoke/test_packaging_contract.py) | Floors raised to dotenv 1.2.1, hatchling 1.27.0, googleapis-common-protos 1.73.1. The lock is refreshed. |
| K7 | fixed | [.github/workflows/tests.yml](.github/workflows/tests.yml) | CI uses `uv sync --locked`. |
| K9 | fixed | [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) | The sdist now holds only source, tests and top-level metadata. A local build confirmed it. |
| K10 | fixed | [README.md](README.md), [docs/sphinx/guides/quickstart.md](docs/sphinx/guides/quickstart.md) | Install commands use `pip install -U "kentik-api>=2"`. |
| K11 | fixed | [LICENSE](LICENSE) | The markdownlint comment is gone. |
| K12 | fixed | [Makefile](Makefile), [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) | `make deep-clean` keeps `uv.lock`. |
| K3, K8 | deferred | [reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/deferred-risks.md](reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/deferred-risks.md) | K3 needs a published docs site or a short PyPI README. K8 needs a clean-venv wheel job. |
| D7, D8, D9, D10 | fixed | [tests/smoke/test_docs_contract.py](tests/smoke/test_docs_contract.py) | CHANGELOG command, the literal `\n`, the 1.x Python row, the `make help` regex, and the agent front matter are corrected. The pagination claim in `docs/README.md` is deferred. |
| D3, D4, D6, D11 | deferred | [reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/deferred-risks.md](reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/deferred-risks.md) | These are hand-written doc rewrites and need owner review. |
| D1, D2, D5, D12 | deferred | [reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/deferred-risks.md](reports/pre-pr-audit-2026-10-10/deferred-risks.md) | These need generator and template changes. |

Verification (2026-10-12): full mocked suite passes (3004 passed, 145 skipped), `uv lock --check` passes, and a local `uv build` gives a clean sdist. The Sphinx build was not run, because `make docs` regenerates from the schema.

## Final verification gates (2026-10-12)

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `make test` | 3004 passed, 145 skipped, 468 deselected |
| `uv run ruff check .` and `ruff format --check .` | Pass |
| `make typecheck` | Pass (one `ty` ignore comment corrected in `tests/runtime/test_transport_symmetry.py`) |
| `make check-specs` | Pass (the 004 tasks now cite every FR and SC) |
| `make check-changelog SINCE=HEAD` | Pass |
| `uv lock --check` | Pass |
| `sphinx-build -W --keep-going` | Build succeeded |
| `make generate local` | Tree unchanged (run after the generator fixes) |

### Manual spot-check replay

| Check | Finding | Verdict | Reading |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | B13 | reproduced (probe) | The probe copies the old test harness and does not drop `api_config_override`. The real test in `tests/e2e/test_endpoints_e2e.py` drops it and asserts the host. B13 stays fixed. |
| C2 | B5 | inconclusive | The leak no longer shows in the probe output. This matches the fix. |
| C3 | B6 | inconclusive | The probe exits non-zero without a segfault marker. A closed channel now raises `ConfigurationError`. This matches the fix. |
| C4, C5 | B7, B1 | not run | They call the real API. Live runs are opt-in, and nobody opted in. Mocked tests cover both. |

## Final validation outcome

- No finding was disproven by the evidence corpus.
- Most blocker and runtime findings are directly reproducible in this environment.
- A small subset is validated by static inspection or requires targeted external fixtures/scratch setup.
- The report is directionally and technically correct enough to use as the remediation driver.
