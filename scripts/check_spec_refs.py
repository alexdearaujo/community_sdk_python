"""Validate cross-artifact identifier references inside `specs/`.

Renumbering a sequential ID rewrites the key every sibling artifact points at,
so a stale reference survives as a *real but wrong* pointer that no Markdown
tool notices. Three renumbering passes on feature 003 left twelve of them.

The orphan check below is the one that catches that class. A dangling-reference
check cannot, because the references still resolve. But a renumber shifts a
whole block at once, which always strands the requirements at the block's edge
with no citation left, and that is detectable.

Known limit: a single hand-typo'd citation that lands on another requirement
which some other task still cites will pass. A keyword-overlap heuristic was
tried and rejected: it flagged 7 correct citations and did not distinguish a
seeded defect, so it added noise without signal. Cascades are the recurring
failure and are covered; isolated typos still need a human reading the diff.

Run via `make check-specs`. Exits non-zero and names every offending file.
